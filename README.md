#Git Assignment

I'm assuming you know *something* about HTML and CSS.  If you feel totally clueless on this topic, check out the HTML/CSS tutorial at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com) 

###Instructions
####Part 1#####
2.	Fork this repository.  
1.  Add something to the index.html file 
3.  Initiate a pull request. I'll see your request so there is nothing to submit for this part.

####Part 2#####

1.  Create a repository on GitHub
2.  Create a simple website using HTML and CSS.
3.  Commit your changes to the repository.
4.  Push the updates to the server.
5.  Submit the assignment by pasting the clone URL in the submission box.  If your repository is private, please add me (howardcy) as a collaborator.  Instructions for adding a collaborator are here: [https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
